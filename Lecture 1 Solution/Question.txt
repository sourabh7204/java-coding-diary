                                    VARIABLES & DATA TYPES QUESTIONS


Question 1:
In a program, input 3 numbers: A, B, and C. You have to output the average of these 3 numbers.
(Hint: Average of N numbers is sum of those numbers divided by N)


Question 2:
In a program, input the side of a square. You have to output the area of the square.
(Hint: Area of a square is side × side)


Question 3:
Enter cost of 3 items from the user (using float data type) — a pencil, a pen, and an eraser. You have to output the total cost of the items back to the user as their bill.
(Add-on: You can also try adding 18% GST tax to the items in the bill as an advanced problem)


Question 4:
What will be the type of result in the following Java code?
byte b = 4;
char c = 'a';
short s = 512;
int i = 1000;
float f = 3.14f;
double d = 99.9954;

result = (f * b) + (i % c) - (d * s);


(Hint: Look at the largest data type among these)


Question 5 (Advanced):
Will the following statement give any error in Java?
int $ = 24;
