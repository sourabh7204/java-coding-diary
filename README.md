# Java Coding Diary

This repository is a structured log of my Java learning process. It contains lecture-wise folders with code examples, practice problems, and short conceptual notes. The goal of this project is to maintain a clear and organized record of all foundational Java topics I study.

The content in this repository focuses on building strong core skills, starting with the basics such as variables, data types, operators, type casting, input handling, and simple programs. Each file reflects practical exercises written to reinforce these concepts through clean and readable code.

#### This repository serves the following purposes:

### => To document my daily learning progress in Java

### => To provide a personal reference for revision and future projects

### => To develop consistent coding standards and programming discipline

### => To maintain a well-organized collection of beginner-level Java programs

### => This project will continue to grow as I move into more advanced topics, ensuring a comprehensive diary of my journey as a Java developer.
