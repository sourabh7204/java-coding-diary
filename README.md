# Java Coding Diary 📘

A structured and organized repository documenting my journey of learning **Java programming**.  
This project contains lecture-wise folders with **code examples, practice programs, and conceptual notes**, helping me build a solid foundation in Java.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is designed as a personal learning diary where I store:

- Java basics
- Daily practice programs
- Lecture-wise solutions
- Notes on important concepts
- Clean and readable Java code for revision

The main goal is to **track my progress**, develop **consistent coding habits**, and maintain a **well-organized archive** of all beginner-level Java programs I write.

## 🎯 Objectives of This Project

### ✔ Document my daily learning progress in Java

### ✔ Maintain a personal reference for revision and future projects

### ✔ Improve programming discipline and clean coding standards

### ✔ Organize all lecture-wise programs in a structured format

### ✔ Continuously grow the repository as I learn advanced Java topics
